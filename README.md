# small-tools-for-making-source-header-file
every time I have to add manually header files with “#ifndef...#endif” or other things and source files with “#include”.
This nonsense operation is unaccepted for a lazy man like me(smile).
so, I make a small tool to do my favor.
This is the first version.
All you need to do is give it the name of the file and the namespace's name.
Of course, the files that the tool producted and other files such as iostream should be mannually added in the project.
